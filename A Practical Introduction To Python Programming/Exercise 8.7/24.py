# The following is useful in implementing computer players in a number of different games.
# Write a program that creates a 5 Ã— 5 list consisting of zeroes and ones. Your program should
# then pick a random location in the list that contains a zero and change it to a one. If all the
# entries are one, the program should say so. [Hint: one way to do this is to create a new list
# whose items are the coordinates of all the ones in the list and use the choice method to
# randomly select one. Use a two-element list to represent a set of coordinates.]
