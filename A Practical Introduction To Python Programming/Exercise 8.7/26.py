# We usually refer to the entries of a two-dimensional list by their row and column, like below
# on the left. Another way is shown below on the right.
# (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) 0 1 2
# (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) 3 4 5
# (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) 6 7 8
# (a) Write some code that translates from the left representation to the right one. The // and
# % operators will be useful. Be sure your code works for arrays of any size.
# (b) Write some code that translates from the right representation to the left one.
