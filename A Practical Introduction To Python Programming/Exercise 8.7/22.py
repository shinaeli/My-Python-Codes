# The following is useful as part of a program to play Battleship. Suppose you have a 5 Ã— 5 list
# that consists of zeroes and ones. Ask the user to enter a row and a column. If the entry in the
# list at that row and column is a one, the program should print Hit and otherwise it should
# print Miss.
