# Write a program that prints out a list of the integers from 1 to 20 and their squares. The output
# should look like this:
# 1 --- 1
# 2 --- 4
# 3 --- 9
# ...
# 20 --- 400

for num in range(1, 21):
    print(f'{num} --- {num ** 2}')


# 1 --- 1
# 2 --- 4
# 3 --- 9
# 4 --- 16
# 5 --- 25
# 6 --- 36
# 7 --- 49
# 8 --- 64
# 9 --- 81
# 10 --- 100
# 11 --- 121
