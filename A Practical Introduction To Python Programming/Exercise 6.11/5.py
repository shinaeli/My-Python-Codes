# Write a program that asks the user to enter a string. The program should create a new string
# called new_string from the userâ€™s string such that the second character is changed to an
# asterisk and three exclamation points are attached to the end of the string. Finally, print
# new_string. Typical output is shown below:
# Enter your string: Qbert
# Q*ert!!!


user_input = input('Provide a word: ')
output = user_input[0:1]+'*'+user_input[2:]
print(output)

# Provide a word: Qbert
# Q*ert
# Provide a word: Joshua
# J*shua
